                    Final project for capstone course CS4550 - Web Development. The project is a website built for managing
                    information for the online collectible card game Duelyst. The website is built on a MEAN stack and features
                    a RESTful API that serves as the intermediary between the website and two public APIs developed for Duelyst.
                    The site features card lookup, deck building, tournament organization, and basic social interactions.
