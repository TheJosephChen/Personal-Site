    <p>
        My name is Joseph Chen. I graduated from Northeastern University in May 2018 with my B.S. in Computer science.
        This website currently hosts projects completed in my capacity as a student and will be expanded as I see fit.

                Final project for capstone course CS4550 - Web Development. The project is a website built for managing
                information for the online collectible card game Duelyst. The website is built on a MEAN stack and features
                a RESTful API that serves as the intermediary between the website and two public APIs developed for Duelyst.
                The site features card lookup, deck building, tournament organization, and basic social interactions.
