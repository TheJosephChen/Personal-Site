### About
This project is owned by Joseph Chen and serves as the project root
directory for my undergraduate Capstone course CS4550.

I have working experience in using javascript to add and modify 
functionality for a Windows Application. I do not have experience
building a javascript project from scratch and so am looking to
this course to give me the experience of doing so.
